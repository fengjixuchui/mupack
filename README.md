This is a small executable packer that I have been working on and off for some time. 
There is some bugs:

Most obvious known bugs:
* No load config directory support.

Virus scanners now scan for mupakk, making it somewhat useless now (thanks to people that abused it). 

Source code might be useful for people who want to read how to develop a packer in mostly C though.
